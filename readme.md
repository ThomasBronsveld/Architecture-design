Case Study
If you do the case study, you will hand in all work via a gitlab repo. 

If your current commit must be graded, inform me by email. Make sure I am added to your repo as a developer. 

What you must do for the case study is the following: 
• Create an application that services data to clients with a ‘big’ data pool. 

•The data set will be taken from Kaggle.com. 

Following the process and how to document both from “Designing Software Architectures: A Practical Approach ”[1], the students will create a new software back end with a minimal front end or an awesome front end with a minimal back end. 

Starting point of your knowledge will be what is learned in year 2. EWA taught how a web application is created (keywords: framework, 3 layered architecture, ORM). During AaD this knowledge will be applied that knowledge with new knowledge. For example from a book like “Designing Data-Intensive Applications”[2] for back end or Micro Frontends[3] for front end developer.


Constraints Back End

•	Minimum of 10.000 records in de dataset. 
Multiple dataset can be combined to one lager one, the sets must be compatible.

•	The dataset must be unique per student.

•	The system is a SOA/Microservice architecture, with the minimum of 2 services are built for the final assessment. Services for login/logout/authentication don’t count.

•	A messaging system must be used for communication between services.

•	Each iteration will have different architectural decisions and each iteration the scope of the decisions will be narrowed down. Also, at least 2 patterns from the Linda course  must be applied (Option 1: you can do this by hand, but it must be done on the correct way. Option 2: if the framework already applies 2 patterns, then document this).

•	Don’t copy text from one iteration to another with minimal edits to the text.

•	The front-end can be minimal, it just needs to be able to make calls with filter parameters to the back end. Swagger.io does exactly this for you.

Constraints Front End

•	Back end will be Firebase.

•	Minimum of 10.000 records in de dataset. Multiple dataset can be combined to one lager one, the sets must be compatible.

•	Use a front-end framework.

•	Make at least two pages functional for the final assessment. The login/logout pages don’t count.

•	Front End must be written in Type Script.

•	Each iteration will have different architectural decisions and each iteration the scope of the decisions will be narrowed down. Also, at least 2 patterns from the Linda course  must be applied (Option 1: you can do this by hand, but it must be done on the correct way. Option 2: if the framework already applies 2 patterns, then document this). 

•	Each iteration will have different architectural decisions and each iteration the scope of the decisions will be narrowed down. Also, at least 2 patterns from the Linda course must be applied.

•	Don’t copy text from one iteration to another with minimal edits to the text
